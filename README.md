# libmdadm
A library derived from mdadm utilities and e2fsprog utilities.

In order to conveniently manage the software RAID and the filesystem on it, I tried to implement two modules, RAIDManager and FilesystemManager, to manage software RAID and ext3/ext4 filesystem with mdadm and e2fsprog integration.
